# Aun Otra Ray Tracer

This project is a simple ray tracing project.
The idea is to build and work on ray tracers in different languages and readily available guides and papers.

Some of the resources used in this project are:

* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/)
* [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/)
* [Physically Based Rendering](https://www.pbr-book.org/)

The goal of each implementation is to get them to a point where they can read and render a [pbrt-v3 Input File](https://pbrt.org/fileformat-v3).

## Implementations

The current list of implementations are as follows:

* [Golang](#Golang)

### Golang

At the moment very basic but can render [Wavefront `.obj` files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).
The code can be found [here](go/).
